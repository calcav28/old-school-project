# My Personal Project

For my personal project, I want to make an **interactive, choose your own adventure story game.** In this game, 
you will play as a character going through a spaceship. The application will allow the player to make their own 
choices on what the character does throughout the story and experience the outcome of their decision. 
Some features of the application include:

- *Multiple endings.*
- *Decisions on other characters living and dying.*
- *Saving your progress wherever you want.*

This project is of interest to me because I want to pursue a career in making video games. I also enjoy writing a lot,
and an interactive story game allows me to mix both of those things together. 
It's also a decently simple game to make, and it allows me to be more creative with the story.
